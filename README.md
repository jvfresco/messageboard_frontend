## Message board frontend

This is the frontend for the simple message board application that connects with this [Nodejs backend](https://github.com/jvfresco/messageboard_backend)

The application allows the user to post, edit, and delete messages, performing live updates for users using websockets technology

Based on the Nodejs Academind course and modified by me to use hooks.

- React
- Hooks
- Socket.io client
